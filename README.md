# Covid19Epidemiology

John Hopkins has collected data for COVID-19 cases to be used for general public consumption and analysis.  Other data sets also exist.  The purpose of these set of scripts, developed using experience from the PerlWeeklyChallenge and EZPWC, is to allow collaborative development of such tools mainly in Perl.  The shell eases the processes required to fork this repository, create a local clone and then manages the development of scripts and modules, as well as keeping the data they generate. The objective is NOT to collect all these scripts in this repository, but to ease the development process.

The workflow is in development, and it has to be noted that there are already similar much more advanced collaborative efforts elsewhere. It is however possible that others may find the work here useful, or may wish to contribute. The plan is : -

1) To develop a shell that provides a consistent useful development platform and coding structure
2) To allow development of scripts that transform diverse data sources into formats that ease further manipulation, analysis and transformation
3) To allow development of modules that allow access to these data for visualisation and reporting

The development shell itself is the goal of this project, although some outputs are displayed here both as examples and for consumption.
